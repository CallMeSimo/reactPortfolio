        <p>
          Iâ€™m a web developer & programmer with about one years worth of
          experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WordPress and PHP also have
          experience in other languages such as Python, C#, and PLC
          Structured-text. Some of these I learned while doing collaboration
          projects, some from internships. My work assignments are not always
          relevant to my expertise, but that does not stop me from performing
          them.
